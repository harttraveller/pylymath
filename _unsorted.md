## Note to Sol, Ed

I think the way we will do this is by putting 100% of the responsibility on me, to convey ideas in a way that makes sense, and is easily digestable. If the idea isn't understood, it isn't the fault of the student, but the teacher. As such, running into concepts that you guys have trouble understanding is GOOD, because it is an opportunity for me to figure out how to break down the concept until it is eventually digestable. 

## Summary

This repository is built as a resource for tutoring my elementary school age brother. As such, I've done my best to follow the ELI5 methodology. In this way, many topics are repeatedly covered as one advances. At the early level, a minimally functional understanding of many base concepts is provided. As you progress, these concepts will be built up, and even sometimes, what you learned before will have to be unlearned or replaced with new, deeper knowledge of the material. This isn't a bad thing - often an incorrect understanding must be reached first, as a stepping stone to some higher truth.

One of the major approaches taken is that when a challenge problems are presented, as one progresses, the solutions are actually given inline (at the beginning). These solutions will always appear in every notebook in the tutoring directory. These solutions also will present the problem, and then show how one might try to approach solving the problem step by step. In this way, the goal is to teach how one might approach a problem, by following in the "thought steps" of someone who has solved the problem. Eventually, questions without solutions in the notebook are included in the notebook (though the solutions are included in the pytutorlib.tests module). The difficulty of these questions lags significantly behind the problems with solutions. In this way, the hope is that the person engaging with the material never has to struggle, and that instead the entire process is broken down in such tiny, digestable chunks (that critically, are fun to eat), that one might go through this, and not even realize that they are learning, but after some time, look back in surprise and realize they have learned quite a lot.

Furthermore, in an effort to make this as absolutely fun as possible, the repository leans heavily on (attempted) humor, assisted heavily by the injection of jokes/comics/memes that the read might enjoy. Mark Twain said: "humor is mankinds greatest blessing". Perhaps this is true, but passion, beauty, and wonder, certainly rank quite high in the list of blessings as well. As such, a secondary goal of the repository is not just to teach you python, but to expose you to a variety of ideas, and give you the tools to explore them further should you find yourself inexorably drawn to them.


## Learning structure

0. foundation
1. exploration
2. specialization


The recommended path is as follows:
- Do everything in foundation section
- Do most things in exploration section
- Do some things in the specialization section

The reference section is used to store things that are common to multiple sections. As such, they can be referenced there.

Finally, in order to make this as minimally intimidating as possible, things really are broken into the *smallest* possible chunks, especially at the beginning.


## Getting Started

*Later - will put steps to get started here*

1) Install python
2) Get nominally familiar with the command line
3) Clone repository
4) pip install requirements.txt file
5) pip install git+python tutoring library (this repo same repo - there will be two copies on the machine)
   - this is necessary to access the code in pytutorlib

## Unsorted notes
- If someone can't understand something, they should submit an issue on github. The explanation will then be continually reworked until they can understand it.
- Each topic should have multiple levels of explanation for a single concept

## Syllabus - PATH.md file

- The way things are organized, there is no specific order one would need to do things in. Instead, there is a recommended order, which users can follow along by clicking hyperlinks, though, sections can be skipped of course.
