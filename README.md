## Summary

This repository is built as a 

One of the major approaches taken is that when a challenge problems are presented, as one progresses, the solutions are actually given inline (at the beginning). These solutions will always appear in every notebook in the tutoring directory. These solutions also will present the problem, and then show how one might try to approach solving the problem step by step. In this way, the goal is to teach how one might approach a problem, by following in the "thought steps" of someone who has solved the problem. Eventually, questions will 

## Getting Started

*Later - will put steps to get started here*

1) Install python
2) Get nominally familiar with the command line
3) pip install requirements.txt file
4) pip install git+python tutoring library (this repo)
   - this is necessary to access the code in pytutorlib
